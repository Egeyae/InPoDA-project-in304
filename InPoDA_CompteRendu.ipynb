We used a Genetic Algorithm approach to explore solutions as we were not at ease with backpropagation. The training dataset is Sentiment140, around 1.6 millions tweets annoted for sentiment analysis. We embedded the training tweets using a multilingual model as the project tweets were in french and Sentiment140's are in english.\n",

The predictions are very off the expected results, we get all fed data to be more or less in the same category. Which is strange because during training everything seems fine... An error lies in between training and model usage, perhaps a CPU-GPU error.\n"
